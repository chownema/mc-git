================== NexEngine ==================
A new, better and optimized version of the Core plugin.
This Engine is required for the plugin to run.
Don't forget to check engine settings in /plugins/NexEngine/ folder.

Please, ALWAYS replace the engine .jar from every plugin update.
Remove 'FogusCore.jar' from your /plugins/ folder if you have it - it's an outdated version of this engine.
Also, rename 'FogusCore' folder to 'NexEngine' to keep the core settings.
