So the classes should all match, in case someone still uses CSCL1 (though, our classes should take priority when loaded...), the class signatures should still be compatible.\r\n\r\nThis may need much more testing though before this is ready to be merged.\r\nWe may announce this as a public beta.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n<!-- Please list all the changes you have made. -->\r\n* Removed CS-CoreLib dependency from the `pom.xml`\r\n* Removed CS-CoreLib as a `softDepend` from the `plugin.yml`\r\n* Removed check for CS-CoreLib on startup\r\n* Transferred any \"still-in-use\" classes from CS-CoreLib to the Slimefun src\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you should follow. -->\r\n<!-- You can click those check boxes after you posted your issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have fully tested the proposed changes and promise that they will not break everything into chaos.\r\n- [x] I have also tested the proposed changes in combination with various popular addons and can confirm my changes do not break them.\r\n- [ ] I followed the existing code standards and didn't mess up the formatting.\r\n- [ ] I did my best to add documentation to any public classes or methods I added.\r\n- [ ] I have added `Nonnull` and `Nullable` annotations to my methods to indicate their behaviour for null values\r\n- [ ] I added sufficient Unit Tests to cover my code.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2711","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2711/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2711/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2711/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2711","id":783888959,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3ODM4ODg5NTk=","number":2711,"title":"Crafting items while the Server is restarting","user":{"login":"variananora","id":34732414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzMyNDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/34732414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora","html_url":"https://github.com/variananora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/variananora/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"üêû Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2021-01-12T04:00:56Z","updated_at":"2021-01-13T02:51:45Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"<!-- FILL IN THE FORM BELOW -->\r\n\r\n## :round_pushpin: Description (REQUIRED)\r\n<!-- A clear and detailed description of what went wrong. -->\r\n<!-- The more information you can provide, the easier we can handle this problem. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nItem in Auto Enchanter or Auto Disenchanter will disappear after a server reboot.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/CoIFcN7B7f8\r\n\r\n## :bookmark_tabs: Steps to reproduce the Issue (REQUIRED)\r\n<!-- Tell us the exact steps to reproduce this issue, the more detailed the easier we can reproduce it. -->\r\n<!-- Youtube Videos and Screenshots are recommended!!! -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n1.

Also refactors the Talisman class quite a bit.\r\n\r\nRegarding my Testing results below, I dont know if Ender Talismans are supposed to work in inventories, otherwise the only thing needed to fix is the ability to right click the Ender variant of the Talisman of the Resurrected.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Everything from the old PR\r\n- Add a return statement so it doesnt send 2 messages\r\n\r\n## Testing Results\r\n@ ![img](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/725813223797817372.png?v=1)\r\n\r\nI did some thorough testing and came to the following results:\r\n- Ender Talismans only work in enderchest, not in inventory\r\n- Right clicking on the Ender Talisman of the Resurrected does not set a respawn point\r\n- Both variants of the Talismans of the Anvil, Miner, Wise and Traveller work (I assume the rest works too but I didnt test all of them)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you should follow. -->\r\n<!-- You can click those check boxes after you posted your

Description\r\n<!-- Please explain what you changed/added and why you did it in detail. -->\r\nI am changing Block Tickers to go from an ItemHandler to a proper interface.\r\nThis makes identifying tickers easier and reduces the need for null checks on the getTicker() method, if something is a ticker, it is a ticker.\r\n\r\nThis also reduces nesting a LOT.\r\nThe only thing I am not so fond about yet is the getTickingMethod() method as it is quite a repetitive pattern.\r\nI thought about determining this via sub interfaces of TickingBlock but those would just get confusing to implement for addon devs. The method forces them to implement it and make a decision, even if it may encourage redundance. If you have a better idea let me know.\r\n\r\nThis currently is just a wrapper for the old system, but this layer of abstraction will allow us to handle tickers internally however we want.\r\n\r\n##

Observe how items are transferred into the destroyed Electric Furnace and are destroyed immediately afterwards as the TickerTask processes the removal of the Electric Furnace \r\n\r\nFrom my testing this is a very rare occasion, and as such a very hard bug to reproduce.\r\nHowever, with the help of a debugger which is capable of pausing the async TickerTask, it is reproducible every time\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nThe item does not transfer, or drops in the world\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n - Minecraft Version: v1_15_R1\r\n - Slimefun Version: DEV 489 (git d8964)\r\n - CS-CoreLib Version: v1.6.3\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1161","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1161/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1161/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1161/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1161","id":503004402,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDMwMDQ0MDI=","number":1161,"title":"Automated Crafting Chamber ignores crafting-permissions","user":{"login":"TheFangster","id":55958675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTU4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/55958675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheFangster","html_url":"https://github.com/TheFangster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheFangster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheFangster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheFangster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheFangster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheFangster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheFangster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheFangster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheFangster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheFangster/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"üêû Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2642156940,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjQyMTU2OTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%A7%A8%20Confirmed%20Bug","name":"üß® Confirmed Bug","color":"B3EFFA","default":false,"description":"This bug has been confirmed by our team."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2019-10-05T19:19:24Z","updated_at":"2021-01-08T13:40:21Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Description (Required)\r\n<!-- A clear and detailed description of what exactly the Issue consists of. -->\r\nIndividual permissions for sf items only work in the Enchanted Crafting Table.
